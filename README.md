# ng-KonamiCode
Angular Konami Code

Working on a Angular Konami Code 
 
Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A 


Will be adding more to the project soon. But basically once the Konami code is entered then a ng-show will active. Want to add in other features like redirects, modal, and making this project a module.
